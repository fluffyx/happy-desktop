# Happy Desktop shell

This package is the Electron shell for Happy Desktop on macOS, Windows, and
Linux. It starts or connects to the user's normal local Happy Agent daemon,
projects the daemon through a loopback boundary, and hosts the shared local
application renderer. The shell opens one Happy Agent connection — its host — and that Happy Agent owns whatever peering it
does with other machines.

It contains no Happy server, account authentication, hosted workspace topology,
or plugin runtime. Product state lives in `happy-desktop-state`, reusable
visuals in `happy-desktop-ui`, and application composition in
`happy-desktop-app`.

Start the complete Electron development environment:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

The default is Portless loopback mode (`https://…localhost`); it does not
require Wi-Fi. Use `pnpm dev --lan` only for deliberate device testing.

Use `pnpm dev --debug` to start the development-only main-process, renderer, and
Happy Agent inspectors. Electron prints each loopback URL; set
`HAPPY_DEBUG_RENDERER_PORT` to choose the renderer CDP port explicitly.

Use the profile development flavor from the workspace root:

```sh
pnpm --dir ../.. dev --profile
```

It preloads the dormant collector and labels captures
`development/non-representative`. For optimized profile captures, build once
and launch the production-shaped profile renderer. The optimized flavor remains
minified but requests component-name retention. Every artifact records that
launch request separately from `profileBuildVerified`, which is set only after
the pre-React bootstrap completes an actual React DevTools v5 profiling
lifecycle (the attached renderer version is also checked when it is reported):

```sh
pnpm run build:profile:optimized
pnpm run start:profile:optimized
```

Start and stop a capture in Settings → Dev Tools. Happy writes the raw
Chromium trace, process/heap metrics, and normalized React DevTools 6.1.5
backend profiling payload beside a smaller ranked report and manifest under
its desktop profiler data directory. The backend payload is raw evidence for
Happy's analyzer; it is not the frontend Store export accepted by React
DevTools' profile importer. The existing renderer debugger can stay attached
during capture; competing tracing commands and access to the profiler's trace
stream are rejected.

Use the browser-only environment when needed:

```sh
pnpm dev:web
```
