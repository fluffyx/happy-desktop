/**
 * C-161 SplashScreen — what the window holds while the app decides what to show:
 * the workspace surface with the Happy mark centered on it, and nothing else by
 * default. The mark renders muted rather than at full strength, because this
 * screen means "still waking up", not "here is the Happy brand" — a strong
 * mark reads as a deliberate splash and fights the crossfade
 * it is about to lose. It carries no spinner, because it is on screen only as
 * long as the first probe takes and anything more would flash; the optional
 * `note` and `steps` exist for the case that isn't instant — a local Happy Agent
 * that has to start — and neither shifts the mark's position when it appears.
 * They are held back for the first moments by the stylesheet rather than by a
 * timer here, so a start that resolves quickly shows the mark alone and a start
 * that does not explains itself. The owner crossfades
 * this screen to whatever resolves — the sign-in card or the workspace — so the
 * mark dissolves rather than cutting away. Props only: no timers, no state, no
 * animation of its own.
