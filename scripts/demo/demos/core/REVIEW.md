# Core demo — local review

## Release Coordinator and current upstream avatar sync — v21-r2

Release Coordinator is a real non-admin bot in the isolated daemon, with the
exact user-selected DiceBear Adventurer Neutral `Celia` avatar. The desktop
sidebar and real iPhone list both show the bot and the selected face. The main
agent inspected the native `phone-home.png`; no native image mapping, overlay,
or new avatar API was introduced. The image source and CC BY 4.0 attribution
are retained beside `assets/release-coordinator.png`.

At the user's request, the clean local Agent branch was fetched and rebased
onto `origin/main` at `6bda0269`, yielding `b0c27015` with the local clean-Git
transition fix preserved. Upstream already supplied encrypted bot-avatar sync
(`059c649a`) and the archive echo fix (`df615786`). A fresh disposable build
uses those sources directly, version `0.4.70-local.core`; nothing was installed
into or restarted in the user's real Electron/Agent host.

The native workspace was also rebased to `f75999ee` on `a1eae8de`, preserving
the four message-status edits byte-for-byte. Its paired private database was
backed up before the existing upstream session-avatar migration ran. Native
typecheck, server build, and iOS export passed. The first v21 attempt stopped
off camera because the tool runtime restart had stopped the private server.
Restoring that same server recovered the session list without resetting or
re-pairing; the second attempt passed.

The captured v21-r2 timeline is 3,867 frames at 60fps (64.45s). Phone focus runs
from 34.783333s to 49.566667s. Astra is genuinely idle by 52.1s, before Deployed
at 59.283333s; final child activity and the final UI assertions pass. Both
actual human messages retain Auto. `core.evidence.json` includes the real bot
identity/avatar and the authoritative activity. The real phone list retains
one older rehearsal session whose archival happened while the server was
offline; the recording does not cosmetically hide or replace that row.

The website's focused-phone motion and download-row checks passed at 390,
1440, and 1920px, including no lateral move where the enlarged phone already
fits. Seven further offline Chromium scenarios verified detected-platform
primary downloads, direct production URLs, shared latest-release lookup,
future stable resolution, safe production fallback, and rejection of preview
or foreign download URLs. The Windows/Linux logos use the existing platform
glyphs at `1cap`. The new hero subtitle matches the footer's caption style;
the measured movie position is unchanged. Main inspected the desktop website
screenshot. These are bounded offline checks, not a new HTTP preview or a
publication.

The six v21 website assets were exported and checksum-verified. Both HQ movies
contain 3,867 frames at 60fps (64.45s); both standard movies contain 1,934 frames
at 30fps (64.466667s). The standard pair's shared final-frame quantization is
1/60s. Main inspected the encoded phone at 48.1s: a normal ship-it bubble,
no Sending/Queued line, and Auto visible. The final desktop frame shows both
bots and the completed review/deployment ending with no working subagent.
Export evidence is `.context/v18/web-export-IQ0iFx/export-report.json`.

The final v21 website build passed. Main inspected actual-playing screenshots
at 1440 and 390px around 36.6s: the selected face appears on both devices,
the focused phone is fully visible and overlaps the centered desktop, the
right margin meets the parked gap, and there is no loading spinner or page
overflow. Both videos are decoded and playing, with untouched native desktop
controls. Images and measurements are in `.context/v21/clean-hero/`.
The recording command exited successfully, and the private native server and
Metro were stopped after export; pairing and data remain preserved.

## Finished review and focused-phone follow-up — v20-r1

The website places App Store and Google Play in one centered row below the
macOS installation controls, retaining a vertical stack at 480px and narrower.
The parked phone stays unchanged. On focus it grows by 1.18 and translates left
only enough to preserve a right viewport margin at least equal to its parked
gap from the desktop. It can overlap the desktop; sufficiently wide viewports
need no translation. This replaces v19's always-clear-composer focus rule.

The previous screenplay deliberately held Astra until after the take. It now
releases the review during the shipping command and waits for authoritative
idle child activity before allowing the Deployed reply. The final UI must also
contain no Working in subagents status. A short real collaborator report is
allowed to arrive naturally; no running status is hidden cosmetically.

The v20-r1 capture passed: Astra completed at 52.433s, before Deployed at
59.433s. The final activity has an idle child, zero running descendant agents,
and zero running child processes. The parent shipping turn also completed and
the visible final transcript has no Working in subagents. The take contains
3,877 frames at 60fps (64.616667s), with phone focus from 34.95s to 50.166667s.
Auto and the disclosed offline shipping fixture remain unchanged.

## Auto-mode revision — final take v19-r3

The current acceptance is the v19 section in `SCRIPT.md`. The v18 Full-access
phone interaction and animated wave below are historical, not approved
behavior for this revision.

Root causes addressed:

- The screenplay omitted `<slug>` from its automatic naming response. It now
  supplies `Add voice waveform` and `voice-waveform` through the ordinary
  naming service. Prior active rehearsal names are moved to unique take IDs
  before archival so they do not reserve the next take's generated name.
- Full access was previously used to make the demo's real Git push execute.
  It is removed. Shipping uses the earlier user-authorized offline simulation:
  explicit fixture command lookup inside an ordinary Auto shell, no Git
  history/remote writes during the filmed command, and only the known waveform
  file restored to baseline. The real Git watcher publishes the clean state.
  The fixture is not a permission reviewer and emits no approval verdict.
- The wave sticker is removed; `Hi, Steve 👋` is ordinary static inline text.
- Native pending meant awaiting acceptance, not necessarily queued. The mobile
  client now captures the parent run's activity at submission in typed message
  metadata. Online idle sends render normally while still awaiting the actual
  receipt. A later run started by that message cannot make it look queued.
  Offline and failure status remain visible. Native typecheck/iOS export pass.
- In v19-r2 the full recorded flow and shipping assertions passed, but macOS
  process-group existence probing failed during teardown after the driver
  exited. Teardown now inspects live process-group membership read-only, and
  native synchronization timing is persisted before cleanup. No user host
  Electron process was changed or restarted.

The website was fetched and rebased onto `origin/main` at `08feba1`, preserving
the Homebrew command change. The macOS service runtime cannot host the new
sandboxed workspace preview, so browser verification uses only offline
interception of the built public site; no substitute web listener is exposed.
The final [desktop video](./artifacts/v19-r3/core.mp4) and
[phone video](./artifacts/v19-r3/phone-screen.mp4) contain exactly **3,830
frames at 60fps / 63.833333s**. The website's two 30fps derivatives each
contain **1,915 frames**, with the identical endpoint and no frame-quantization
extension. All four are limited-range BT.709 H.264; the desktop alone has AAC
audio. The six exported assets were checksum-verified after copying into the
website's new `public/video/happy-one/v19/` directory; previous versions remain.

`core.evidence.json` proves both the desktop request and Steve's native message
carry `permissionMode: auto`. `shipping-verified.json` proves baseline HEAD and
origin are unchanged while the real Git read model has no changed files.
`phone-capture.json` preserves a 0.000152542s start trim on the shared clock.
The full recording command, including driver cleanup and screen/bezel export,
exited successfully.

Encoded phone frames at 46.9, 47.3, 47.4, 47.5, 47.8, and 48.1 seconds were
inspected: native typing, then a normal ship-it bubble with no Sending/Queued
line; Auto remains visible. The desktop's 50s frame shows the static inline
emoji beside Steve, no sticker, and the generated voice-waveform name.
Local inspection images are in `.context/v19/`.

The final website build and offline Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit checks pass:
111 records across 11 widths from 320 to 1920px at device scale 2, including
parked/focused geometry and actual continuous playback through both phone cues.
Desktop and macOS-download center errors are at most 0.0078125 and 0.015625 CSS
pixels respectively. The phone clears the composer by at least 6px, clips at
most 48.46% against the viewport (below the allowed 70%), and causes no page
overflow. Both Homebrew copy controls preserve the exact updated command.
Maximum sampled paired-video drift during the handoff is 41.3ms; both pause
together. Native full-resolution seam crops and continuous transition contact
sheets were visually inspected, with no exposed light seam. Main also inspected
the clean desktop/mobile browser screenshots.

Loading overlays in immediate paused-seek diagnostic screenshots were transient
browser controls, not baked into the movies. Follow-up captures after normal
decoded playback retain unmodified native controls and show no spinner. Chrome
and WebKit report no waiting/stalled/error events in that follow-up; Firefox's
HQ phone reports brief startup waiting at the seek and once shortly afterward
on the narrow viewport, then continues normally, with no stall/error. This is
not a claim that every device or network can decode without buffering.

Evidence is in `.context/v19/site-review/` and `.context/v19/site-clean/`.
Offline interception intentionally blocked external Google fonts, so these
checks use font fallback. No replacement HTTP listener, public preview,
commit, push, or deployment was performed for this revision.

## Static-window revision — final take v18-r3

The final [desktop video](./artifacts/v18-r3/core.mp4) and
[native phone screen](./artifacts/v18-r3/phone-screen.mp4) share
**4,194 frames at 60 fps / 69.9 seconds**. Desktop is 1950×1660 (the raw
780×664 CSS-pixel window at 2.5×, no camera), phone 1206×2622. The desktop
encode is limited-range BT.709 with sRGB transfer tags straight from
`encode.mjs`, so the website copies it byte for byte.

Rehearsals before the final take found and fixed, in order: the phone's
`hideKeyboard` step (replaced by a real back tap to the session list); the
phone composer mirroring the session's mode, which reverted an off-camera Full
access preset (now chosen on camera through the real permission menu right
before typing); the sandboxed Bash in Auto mode that cannot commit from a
worktree (Steve's message carries Full access, asserted on the arrived
message); the xcrun `git` shim printing developer-path noise into the Bash
output (the resolved real git is placed on the gym PATH); a leftover
`remote.origin.pushurl` from an earlier fixture that would have pushed
elsewhere (unset in `shippingPrepare`); the baseline read from `origin/main`,
which an earlier real push had moved so the new workspace already contained the
edit (now `refs/heads/main`, and the take asserts exactly one changed file
after the Edit); the Bash row selector (a Bash tool call renders as an
`agent-activity-call`, not the shell-mode row); and the greeting arriving
before the phone had returned (`delayMs` on the ship reply, a shorter hold
after Send, phone-list verification moved off the camera path).

`shipping-verified.json` records the real result: worktree HEAD
`fecd755b` "Animate the voice waveform while speaking", origin `main` equal to
that HEAD, the diff from baseline `cfd375c4` touching only
`packages/happy-app/sources/realtime/waveformActive.ts`, and the daemon's Git
read model at `comparison: ready`, base equal to head, zero changed files. The
screenplay's "Deployed" text is emitted only when the Bash tool result carries
no error and exit code 0; a failed command produces "The push did not go
through. Leaving main untouched." (observed once in rehearsal, when the
baseline bug left nothing to commit).

Contact sheets of the encoded frames were reviewed at 1, 6, 12, 17, 21, 25,
28, 33, 37, 42, 46, 49.5, 54, 55.5, 56.5, 58, 60, 63, 65.5, and 69 seconds:
picker hover order Astra → Opus → Fable, readable typing, Thinking, two
Explore rows, Edit +3 −1, the Astra spawn row with "1 Agent", the completion,
the unread phone list, the diff, the permission menu with Full chosen, native
typing, the sent bubble, the phone back home, greeting with the wave past the
end of its line, the Bash row in its running state, cleared counters,
"Deployed" under confetti, and the final "Completed in 12s" hold. Fixture
disclosures are in `core.evidence.json`.

## Readable-beat revision — final take v17-r6

The final [desktop video](./artifacts/v17-r6/core.mp4),
[native phone screen](./artifacts/v17-r6/phone-screen.mp4), and
[transparent Black Titanium bezel](./artifacts/v17-r6/phone-bezel.webm)
share **4,078 frames at 60 fps / 67.966667 seconds**. Desktop is 2340×1440,
phone 1206×2622, bezel 1406×2822. The native trim is 0.000149875 seconds;
the concurrent native source covers the entire take. The encoded bezel has
alpha mode enabled; its decoded corner alpha is 0 and screen alpha is 255.

`SCRIPT.md` now contains both the target timeline and a measured scene table:
start/end, duration, content budget, and the connection a viewer should make
before the next scene. The actual cue file is authoritative. Thinking appears
at 16.783s and remains alone until 21.067s; the first sentence remains alone
until Read at 23.450s. Steve arrives at 24.500s. The fully typed Grok spawn is
visible at 29.317s, Edit at 32.783s, settled results at 41.017s. The camera
does not leave the center until 44.033s. Phone focus begins at **45.483s**,
the native diff at **49.683s**, and the movie ends at **67.967s**.

The measured CSS center rectangle remains `(288,88,936,576)`, mapped at 2.5×
to `(790,290,2340,1440)`. All 2,478 locked frames have the identical crop.
There are no speed changes or caption overlays. The resting crop is the raw
3060×1660 application window, fit on its flat background. No wallpaper,
rounded inner frame, shadow, or titlebar is baked into the movie. The website
owns one decorative macOS-style frame; its upright phone protrudes beyond the
right and bottom edges and grows in place only for the ending.

Actual encoded keyframes were viewed for the full-layout opening, picker,
Thinking, first response, Steve, completed Grok label, Edit, review/research
completion and link, unread native home, colored narrow diff, keyboard,
sent message, staged shipping acknowledgement, and clean home ending. The
phone no longer displays What's New, does not add an unnecessary second diff
swipe, and returns normally home before parking. Eight genuine native key
touches take 1.781s; keyboard-to-Send is 2.483s. Exact durable `ship it`, real
unread/read state, and zero final change counters are all asserted.

The unchanged HQ masters and eight derivatives/posters/stills were exported
to website `public/video/happy-one/v17/`. All ten assets passed dimensions,
clock, decoded-frame counts for the movies, and copied SHA-256 verification.
The matched 30fps pair is 1560×960 and 804×1748, 2,039 frames each, with exactly
the same endpoint as HQ: no quantization padding or retiming. Export evidence
is `.context/core-web-export-UgdGdo/export-report.json` (scratch, not committed).
Older v16 assets remain available for rollback.

The mobile portrait crop was rejected because it removed real message prose.
The default is the real narrower screenshot, visible sidebar/Edit +3−1/Fable
picker, and a partially peeking phone. A readable HTML description, full-size
image link, and explicit uncropped 30fps Play option preserve access to the
content without relying on tiny screenshot text. Only two supporting captions
appear below playback: multi-provider work and the encrypted mobile app.

### Real backend causes, fixes, and staging boundary

The archive flood was a real Agent bug: `HappySessionClient` regenerated
`lifecycleStateSince` with `Date.now()` for every echoed archive metadata update.
Each echo therefore required another write and prevented `settle()` from
finishing. Caching the single archive-transition timestamp breaks the loop.
The unchanged regression reproduced four writes before the fix, then passed;
the local commit and complete verification remain documented below.

A second real bug appeared when the last file change was cleared.
`GitStateTracker.#flushDirty` treated empty path-scoped `git status` output as an
irrelevant filesystem event. Dirty-to-clean naturally produces empty status,
so the published tracked snapshot kept +3/−1 until its two-minute stale timer.
The independently scanned Git HTTP API already returned zero, but the encrypted
phone metadata reads the published tracked snapshot. This was not a native
badge-rendering bug.

The fix in isolated Agent commit `c88cebdf76a0d0301d2c83403b2032da75e725a9`
rescans when an event overlaps a previously changed path (including previous
rename paths); missing or truncated snapshots conservatively rescan. The
ignored-noise optimization remains for unrelated paths. Its real-Git regression
failed unchanged before the fix and passed afterward. All 17 focused Git tests,
module checks/typechecks/build, and formatting passed. The branch was based on
fresh Agent main `a205db54` and remains local, independent of the archive fix.

The recording uses private build `0.4.69-local.core.c88cebdf`, combining those
two fixes in an isolated non-Git build copy. The combined focused Git and
session-client regressions pass 38/38. No host binary was installed, no Electron
host was changed or restarted, and no new Agent preview is implied. The earlier
denied Agent main push has not been retried or delegated; publication of these
backend fixes still requires fresh authorization.

Inference copy/timing, Steve's protocol-fixture identity, and the final
“Pushed to main. New version is being deployed.” sentence are screenplay.
The user explicitly authorized staging the shipping outcome. Only the exact
owned generated waveform edit is restored to its baseline; the actual watcher,
Git API, encrypted sync, and phone then publish genuinely clean counters.
No push/deployment or fabricated permission approval happens for the shot.
Real delegation, file work, native keyboard input, message delivery, and sync
are retained. `shipping-verified.json` explicitly records the staging boundary.

### Review and publication status

Local final-asset Chromium/Firefox/WebKit checks pass for 117 playback/control
records, nine static mobile cases at 320/390/430px, and 15 enlarged-text/reflow
cases. They cover actual movie frames, paired seeks, keyboard End → Replay,
sole desktop audio, keyboard opt-in focus under reduced motion/save-data,
full-size still navigation, no unwanted static movie loads, and no page
overflow. Main also viewed the resulting desktop/mobile website screenshots.
Normal-speed Chromium HQ playback ran the entire 67.967s movie in 68.064s;
Firefox and WebKit ran the 43s-to-end phone handoff at 30fps in 25.008s and
25.019s. No waiting/error events occurred. Maximum sampled pair drift was
9.97ms, 5.04ms, and 0.283ms respectively. All three passed viewport pause/resume,
explicit-pause persistence, and dynamic reduced-motion pause. Forward/back
transition screenshots retain the exact upright frame. Website typecheck and
production build pass. These measurements do not establish universally zero
dropped frames. Publication verification is recorded separately below.

Grok 4.6 Extra High's earlier keyframe/OCR review informed the Thinking hold,
whole-block pacing, completed spawn-label wait, faster native typing, removed
extra swipe, closed-keyboard ending, and rejection of the mobile prose crop.
Its final encoded-take review could not start: the reviewer rejected inherited
context exceeding its 500,000-token limit. No final Grok sign-off is claimed.
Antigravity/Fable sharing remains denied and was not retried. Own inspection
and browser measurements are not represented as those reviewers' approval.

Website commit `9ddea01` contains the completed v17 assets, player, and docs.
It was fetched/rebased onto current website `origin/main` without conflicts.
Auto review then refused the command that would build/check and normally push
`HEAD:main`. No push was attempted through another route and no v17 Pages
deployment occurred. Fresh scoped authorization is pending in
`gyykef4vsrivbvf0z02sm3az`; the user was unavailable after 60 seconds. The live
page remains v16 at `9f32a1d`. This is a publication blocker, not an unfinished
recording or an assertion that the final local browser checks failed.

## Stable-center revision — final take v16-r14

The final local [desktop video](./artifacts/v16-r14/core.mp4),
[native phone screen](./artifacts/v16-r14/phone-screen.mp4), and
[transparent Black Titanium bezel](./artifacts/v16-r14/phone-bezel.webm)
share 3,801 frames at 60 fps: 63.350 seconds. Desktop is 2340×1440;
phone is 1206×2622; the precise bezel canvas is 1406×2822. Native capture
trim is 0.000125042 seconds, and its source covers the entire take.

The center crop remains identical for all 2,248 frames from 2.733s through
40.200s. There are zero overlaid caption frames and zero speed changes.
Actual encoded desktop and phone key frames were inspected: full-layout
opening, readable Fable hover, Steve steering, typed Grok spawn, completed
research link, real unread badge, narrow colored diff, native keyboard,
typed message, and acknowledgement. The separately captured mobile still
now keeps `Edit waveformActive.ts +3 −1` above the real model menu, with
project sidebar and Fable above Opus visible. A real upward wheel gesture
disengages follow-tail before framing; the still has a geometry assertion.

| Cue                                   |         Seconds |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------: |
| Picker open / Fable selected          |  5.317 / 10.000 |
| Work starts / Steve steers            | 16.783 / 19.533 |
| Grok spawned / response settled       | 23.867 / 37.033 |
| Phone foreground / session opened     | 41.633 / 44.833 |
| Phone diff visible / keyboard visible | 47.017 / 52.883 |
| Phone message sent / phone parked     | 58.767 / 60.833 |

The phone uses actual native key taps through the existing, serialized XCTest
driver. Its listening process is checked against the simulator UDID before
touches; ambiguous touches are never retried. Eight touches, including Shift,
took 2.767 seconds. Exact `ship it` text and the durable acknowledgement are
verified. The recorder now owns the entire native automation process group,
including XCTest's host restart process; final cleanup left no native driver
or listener. This fixes a separate failed-take collision, not the archive bug.

The website v16 export copies the unchanged 60 fps masters. Matched lighter
files are 1560×960 and 804×1748, each 1,901 frames at 30 fps / 63.366667s.
That explicit 1/60s final-frame quantization is necessary for an odd native
frame count; neither master nor the common event timeline is retimed.
All ten website assets passed measured dimensions/clock and SHA-256 copy
verification. The bezel's decoded alpha is zero outside the frame and 255 on
the screen; its actual encoded diff frame was inspected.

Final website typecheck/build pass. Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit passed paired
playback controls, pointer seeking, keyboard End → Replay for both quality
pairs, off-screen pause, and reduced motion. The final seek-step fix removes
the 0.05s increment that made the 30fps endpoint unreachable. All three engines
at 320/390/430px and 200% text passed the mobile no-movie-request, full-size
keyboard link, and reflow checks; a scoped wrapping fix preserves the header
link at enlarged text. Actual final desktop/mobile screenshots were viewed.

Chromium's five-second sample added zero dropped frames. WebKit's counters
reported drops even for one plain video: 81 versus 85 on the page; a plain pair
reported 89/90. Plain 30fps produced 149 frame callbacks in five seconds.
This does not establish page-specific playback overhead or universally perfect
60fps presentation. Do not misreport the browser checks as zero drops everywhere.

## Archive fix and publication boundary

The current script is `SCRIPT.md`. Recorder base checkpoint `fdf2690f` is rebased onto
Desktop main `8f3820f65b55d8869022fafe823d98e896d87b10`; it remains local.
The current real center rectangle is CSS `(288,88,936,576)`, mapped to crop
`(790,290,2340,1440)` in the captured scene. Output is exactly 2340×1440 at 60 fps,
without stretching. The narrowed separate still uses an 840×664 viewport at
2.5× device scale (2100×1660). Its actual model picker, project sidebar, and
`Edit waveformActive.ts +3 -1` row were visually inspected and are not clipped.

The explicit sub-agent model contract and product presentation are published:

- Client `0.0.66-preview.2`, workflow `34966773558`; stable npm latest remains
  `0.0.65`.
- Desktop renderer `0.0.85-preview.3`, workflow `34969546290`, source `8f3820f6`;
  verified on the Nightly renderer URL. No native Electron release or host edit.
- Agent `0.4.69-preview.4`, workflow `34969855394`, source `7585e70c`;
  all platform/signing/release jobs passed. GitHub latest stable remains
  `v0.4.68`. The isolated recorder's downloaded Darwin arm64 binary passed its
  SHA-256 check, codesign verification, and version check.

Rehearsal `artifacts/v16-r10` visibly contains the real typed
`Spawned Grok 4.6 sub-agent` row after Steve's steering message. It is not a
final deliverable: the phone's actual unread-state assertion failed after the
desktop response completed, so the recorder refused to encode it as a final take.

Diagnosis established a real Agent archive feedback loop. `HappySessionClient`
recomputes `lifecycleStateSince: Date.now()` while archiving, so its own echoed
metadata update continually changes the next payload and prevents `settle()`
from completing. Archived rehearsals reached tens of thousands of metadata
versions (one reached 46,032), overwhelming native JavaScript. The same native
process recovered after the isolated publisher stopped, without debugger
pause/resume, relaunch, or navigation; queries then took 2–5 ms. A separate
native Header Unistyles warning was fixed and verified, but was not the cause
of this remaining flood. No native synchronization workaround was added.

The user explicitly approved the scoped Happy Agent regression test. Fresh
Auto review allowed it; the unchanged test reproduced four metadata writes
on the old code, then passed after caching one archive-transition timestamp.
Local Agent commit `6b16118e` is rebased onto `3fe0b685`. All 2,650 runnable
module tests, build/type checks, and 55 release-script tests passed; six module
tests are platform-skipped. Independent code review found no actionable issue.
No native synchronization workaround, schema, or API specification change was
needed.

Auto review refused pushing that fix to remote Agent main. The exact action
is awaiting fresh human authorization in `if2s2ngcxbzzicw0j0oflqad`; it has not
been retried or routed around. Recording instead uses the isolated local binary
`0.4.69-local.archive.6b16118e`, with no host installation or restart. Antigravity/
Fable external sharing remains pending in `jpl5niwo2i2osl7y19juhkop`; no external
review is claimed.

Website changes include a separate static mobile lifetime, captions below the
desktop video, cue-only phone focus, and lazy buffering that reaches `canplay`.
The v16 assets now come from the final take, not provisional rehearsals.
Website work was rebased onto `a70cbd6`, preserving newer download and ratings
changes. The earlier `d5b2ca7` v15 media remain available as a rollback.

The final website update was normally pushed to remote main as
`9f32a1d01639ffbf124a68948d0844585477803b`. Pages workflow `35036548049`
passed its tests, build, and deployment. The temporary destination remains
https://happy.engineering/tmp/happy-one/. This website publication does not
publish the separately approval-blocked Agent archive fix or change the host.
Live-page verification also passed in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit: actual
v16 playback, exact crop/dimensions, pointer seek, Replay, late phone cue,
off-screen pause, and reduced motion. All nine live mobile width/browser cases
loaded no videos, had no overflow or page errors, and opened the full-resolution
still with visible keyboard focus. Published desktop keyboard and mobile focus
screenshots were visually inspected.

## Upright flat frame and original-detail 60 fps website

The upright flat iPhone and footer credits shipped first as website `1e417f2`
(Pages `34890487646` succeeded), after preserving remote `d990451`'s mobile
feature-reveal changes during rebase. `HappyOnePhone3D.tsx`, the scene renderer,
and its model remain as an unused alternative; the active page imports none of
them and requests no 3D assets. Credits now sit beside Docs, Privacy, and Terms.

The separate quality pass shipped as `d5b2ca7778ff35cfb8da76c5149aa5e2252bf57d`
(Pages `34891633037` succeeded). Its 2560×1440 desktop was recomposed from the
original 3060×1660 captures in their 3200×1800 scene. The closest 347 frames
were widened slightly to a minimum 2560×1440 crop, avoiding upscaling. Website
phone playback uses the unchanged native 1206×2622 export. Both files have
4,674 frames at 60 fps / 77.900 seconds. No re-record or native host change was
needed; original masters and the unused 3D assets remain intact.

Found a cadence issue in the old composition export: ffprobe established that
its JPEG concat input used a 1/25 time base, producing repeated 40ms timestamps
before the output frame-rate conversion. The new desktop encode reads the
numbered captured/composed frames directly at 60 Hz. It does not interpolate
or manufacture intermediate motion. Caption timing, interaction sounds, native
phone timing, and the full synchronized take's duration are unchanged.

Media Capabilities chooses the high-quality pair before either source loads,
only when both are reported supported, smooth, and power-efficient. Unsupported
or data-saving environments retain the existing 30 fps pair; the source does
not switch mid-playback. Runtime inspection covered normal and forced fallback
selection in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. All sampled playback intervals
reported zero dropped frames. Chromium delivered about 59 presented-frame
callbacks/sec at high quality; Firefox callback delivery stayed around 24/sec
in this automation environment despite 60 decoded frames/sec and zero reported
drops, so those callbacks do not establish 60 visible updates/sec there. Headed
WebKit delivered about 54 callbacks/sec versus about 30 for the standard pair.
The videos remained synchronized. Actual desktop text crops, phone home/diff,
and desktop/mobile footer placement were inspected. Website typecheck/build
and diff checks passed; no tests were added. Desktop/phone source was not pushed.

## Website zoom flicker correction

Reproduced the reported zoom jitter in headed hardware Chromium. The original
width transition repeatedly resized the WebGL drawing buffer in ResizeObserver,
after the frame's draw. A single zoom produced 100 canvas-attribute mutation
batches, including 66 transparent center-pixel reads. Intermediate screenshots
showed the phone disappearing, despite smooth animation-frame timing.

The fix keeps the phone's layout/canvas at expanded size and animates only its
CSS transform. Genuine layout resizes are queued and applied immediately before
the same frame's draw; initial presentation waits for the first measured size.
The identical zoom diagnostic then reported no canvas mutations, no resize-induced
blank states, and no frame gaps over 25ms. Intermediate screenshots retained the
phone. Real playback entrance/exit also produced no canvas resizes; a subsequent
window resize produced an opaque center-pixel read in its resize observer batch.

Hardware Chromium, four-core Firefox fallback, and mobile WebKit playback were
inspected. The videos remained aligned, reduced motion paused them, and mobile
retained its existing caption-safe reveal with no WebGL assets or overflow.
Website typecheck/build and diff checks passed. Only the three scoped website
files were committed, rebased onto remote main, and pushed as `fa556a4`.
Native footage, desktop recorder changes, and the Electron host were untouched.
Pages workflow `34888278115` succeeded. The same diagnostic against the published
page reported zero canvas mutations, no resize-induced blank states, and a
maximum animation-frame gap of 9.4ms; its mid-zoom screenshot retained the phone.

## Precise black device and responsive website revision

The [new black-frame export](./artifacts/v13/phone-bezel-iphone16pro-black.webm)
uses the original native screen under Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Black Titanium
frame, sourced through James Jingyi's Device Mockups collection. Its exact
screen opening is 102,100,1206,2622 in a 1406×2822 canvas. The 60 fps VP9-alpha
file contains 4,674 frames / 77.900 seconds; decoded alpha is 0 outside and 255
on the screen. The encoded diff frame was visually inspected. Original footage,
timing, native masters, and the earlier bezel export remain unchanged.

The website revision uses this precise frame by default and an actual CC-BY
iPhone 16 Pro model by tranminhluan on capable desktops. It preserves the sourced
body, button, camera, and antenna geometry and adapts its atlas to neutral black.
Public artwork credits record author, sources, license, and modifications. The
16 Pro is deliberately identified correctly: 17 Pro has no black finish.

The caption-free desktop web derivative retains the v13 77.900-second clock,
camera moves, interaction sounds, and 30 fps encode. Responsive HTML captions
use the original narration cues. Mobile now uses a centered portrait phone
moment, 16px captions, and complete phone exit before desktop review.

Actual normal-speed playback was inspected at entrance, chat/diff arrival,
panned diff, and desktop return. Headed hardware Chromium used the real WebGL
model; native WebKit mobile played both recordings in sync without requesting
Three.js or the model. Firefox layouts at 360px and 430px had no horizontal
overflow. A four-core desktop also requested no 3D assets. Deliberate context
loss returned to the precise flat frame without stopping either video; reduced
motion paused the pair. Final website typecheck/build and diff checks passed.
No tests were written, and the policy-blocked external reviews were not retried.

Website commit `861b5fa5e751ee6bb732bee5e05e0f1c09881a52` was rebased onto
remote main and pushed normally. Pages workflow `34859011794` passed its existing
tests, build, and deployment. Actual published playback was then watched again
at the diff and desktop-return cues. Hardware Chromium loaded the real model;
390px WebKit loaded no 3D assets, kept 16px captions, and hid the phone on exit.
Both had no page errors or horizontal overflow. At the 44-second observation,
the two video clocks differed by about 42ms on desktop and 4ms on mobile.

## Published synchronized take — v13

[Desktop](./artifacts/v13/core.mp4),
[native phone screen](./artifacts/v13/phone-screen.mp4), and
[transparent bezel](./artifacts/v13/phone-bezel.webm) each contain exactly
4,674 frames at 60 fps: 77.900 seconds. The bezel's decoded alpha is 0 outside
the device and 255 on its screen. Native phone capture covers the full take;
its trim offset is 0.000179 seconds. No phone frames or sync data were fabricated.

Phone home has six real durable sessions with actual project artwork: three
Happy sessions, travel-vibes, bra1nDump, and the only bot, Chief of Staff. The
phone's actual model/effort selection is Fable 5.1 / Extra High. Local native
accessibility reads keep the recording driver warm during the desktop opening.

Phone focus begins at 30.717s, chat is open at 34.300s, and the actual inline
diff arrives between 36.5s and 37.0s. The horizontal swipe settles by 43.317s;
focus returns to desktop at 48.200s. No session-info or separate Changes view
is opened on the phone. Desktop file review begins at 60.550s and retains both
sidebars through Unified / No wrap → Wrap → close file tab → chat.

Inspected the native home, diff arrival, panned syntax highlighting, desktop
subtitle beats, completed research link, and ending. Merged one 13-frame subtitle
into the following narration beat during composition; capture timing is unchanged.
The full desktop black-frame scan found no black interval. Phone typecheck and
targeted recorder formatting/lint/syntax checks passed; no tests were written.

The user explicitly selected this take for publication. Website commit
`ead7329` was rebased onto current remote main and pushed to `slopus.github.io`.
GitHub Pages workflow `34853964365` passed its existing tests, build, and deploy.
The demo is live at https://happy.engineering/tmp/happy-one/ with the lightweight
CSS 3D phone. Matched website derivatives use 30 fps, with the phone at 804×1748;
the native 60 fps masters above remain intact. Real browser inspection covered
Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, including seeking and reduced-motion behavior;
paired off-screen pause/resume was checked in Chromium. Deployed WebKit replay
returns both videos to zero and restarts them together. Over a five-second
sample WebKit reported 41 dropped frames with one plain desktop video, 41/43
with two plain videos, and 44/44 on the deployed page. These similar counts do
not establish an added problem caused by the phone treatment; no follow-up
code change or deployment was warranted by this check.

Recording boundaries remain explicit: inference text/timing and Steve's desktop
identity are screenplay fixtures; native tools, edits, and encrypted phone sync
are real. The research post was verified outside the recording. Antigravity and
Fable review did not run because of the policy denial documented below. This is
not a claim of their sign-off. No production Electron host was changed or restarted,
and neither the desktop nor phone source workspace was pushed.

## Synchronized desktop and phone — v11

The revised [desktop video](./artifacts/v11/core.mp4) and
[native phone screen](./artifacts/v11/phone-screen.mp4) contain exactly 4,876
frames each: 81.266667 seconds at 60 fps. The
[transparent bezel treatment](./artifacts/v11/phone-bezel.webm) uses the same
screen source and also contains 4,876 frames at 60 fps. Its decoded alpha is
transparent outside the device and opaque on the screen; the rounded frame and
hardware buttons were inspected in the encoded result.
[Focus cues](./artifacts/v11/phone-timing.json) and
[voiceover subtitles](./artifacts/v11/core.srt) accompany the exports.

Locally inspected the rendered desktop opening and ending, all subtitle beats,
the phone's working session list, active conversation, real +14/−6 update, and
syntax-highlighted file diff. A natural horizontal swipe brings the changed
logic into view. The desktop keeps both sidebars open through Unified / No wrap,
clicks Wrap, and closes only the file tab back to chat. The completed research
finding visibly links to a verified OpenAI Developers post. The full desktop
black-frame scan found no black interval.

The phone is a dedicated iPhone 17 Pro Simulator running the real Happy app,
paired through its encrypted integration to the same isolated demo daemon.
No mobile messages, sessions, diffs, or transport responses are injected.
Both captures run concurrently at continuous 1×. Simulator's changed-frame
recording covers the full exported timeline; no frozen tail is manufactured.
The screen export's last frame remains on the diff, with no off-camera reset.

Phone focus starts at 30.717s, the session is open by 38.450s, the panned diff
is visible by 49.367s, and focus returns to desktop at 59.917s. Desktop file
review begins at 63.933s. All cues use the same zero-based playback clock.

The inference screenplay and fictional Steve identity remain the same explicit
recording boundary as before. Actual phone synchronization is not evidence of
live vendor inference or real multi-user authentication. The tweet was verified
outside the take; the Grok response is scripted.

Targeted formatting, script lint (zero warnings/errors), Node syntax checks,
and `git diff --check` passed. The real desktop renderer and native mobile app
ran for the capture; no tests were written or test suites run. The supporting
Happy environment lives in its separate `core-demo-phone-recording` workspace.
No production Electron host, deployment, release, commit, or push was performed.

Independent Antigravity/Fable review remains blocked as described below; this
local inspection does not claim their sign-off.

## Earlier desktop-only take — v09

Previously reviewed [v09 video](./artifacts/v09/core.mp4),
[subtitles](./artifacts/v09/core.srt), and
[native evidence](./artifacts/v09/core.evidence.json).
Generated takes are gitignored; no video has been selected for committing or publishing.

The file is 53.183 seconds, 1920×1080, 60 fps, H.264/AAC, 3,733,215 bytes.
It was recorded against desktop `4e05ac78` and the isolated stable daemon
`0.4.68`. Narration is subtitles for later human recording; audio contains
interaction sounds, not generated speech.

## Local inspection

Inspected the rendered opening, model selection, typing and marker, Steve's
message, running delegates, work-speed transition, and final diff, including
the encoded ending. The wider composer framing keeps the complete request
visible. The final Split view uses the full content width and wraps long lines.
The first frame is the product with no open menu. No workspace creation,
manual naming, Steve draft, title card, decorative sticker, or black transition
is filmed. FFmpeg's full-video black-frame scan reported no black interval.

Native history establishes the causal order below. Times are elapsed since
the implementation request was submitted, not edited-video timestamps:

| Event                                                      | Seconds |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------: |
| Fable's first completed Read                               |   1.259 |
| Steve's completed message submitted with `delivery: steer` |   3.168 |
| Grok sub-agent created                                     |  10.774 |
| File edited, +14/−6                                        |  16.602 |
| Astra review sub-agent created                             |  24.133 |

The daemon reported healthy and ready; both children settled. Inference and
Steve's identity are fixtures, not proof of live vendor research or real team
authentication. The native tools, steering, file edit, counts, and diff are real.

Repository formatting check and `pnpm format` passed, script lint reported zero
warnings/errors, Node syntax checks passed, and `git diff --check` was clean.
No tests were added or test suites run. Production files and the real Electron
host/daemon were not changed or restarted.

## Outstanding independent review

Antigravity (`agy`, Gemini 3.1 Pro High) and native Fable 5.1 High review commands
were submitted once against v07. Both were refused by Auto review because
sending local documents and imagery to those services violates the workspace's
data-sharing policy. Neither reviewer ran; no alternate route was attempted.
The requested independent sign-off is therefore still blocked. The local cut
is available to inspect, but this is not a claim that all acceptance conditions
or the requested “flawless” sign-off have been met.
